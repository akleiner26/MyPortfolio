    <p>
        My name is Andrew Kleiner, and I live in the greater Philadelphia area.
        I have been a professional lighting designer for 8 years, and have worked for bands
        such as The Head and the Heart and Cold War Kids. Outside of touring, I have done
        large scale events such as the NBA All Star Game, and the NHL All Star Game. I have
        a Bachelor's Degree in Communications with a minor in music composition from
        Tulane University.
